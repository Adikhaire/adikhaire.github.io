I'm a second year undergraduate student currently studying at UCLA. I'm majoring in computer science while also pursuing a minor in Bioinformatics. 

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning to areas in healthcare where we can really engineer better solutions for helping doctors and taking care of patients. In my mind, machine learning and computer science really have the power to make the gradual shift to preventative instead of reactionary healthcare. **If you're working in the healthcare or medical fields, don't hesitate to reach out if you think there's an opportunity for collaboration.**
